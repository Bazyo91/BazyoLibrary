# BazyoLibrary


This is my first class-library for the programming-language Java.
It is not complete and some classes do nearly nothing 
but I am very happy about suggestions for improvement or additions.

In this library I want to simplify creating frames and other components.
A loginform without database-connection is also included.

I've tried use object-oriented programming.
Have fun with this small library wich is growing steadily.
